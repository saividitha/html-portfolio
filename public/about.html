<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Sai Viditha, a student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering in Bengaluru. My academic journey has fueled my passion for technology, particularly in web development, where I enjoy creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. I love the challenge of solving complex problems and continuously strive to enhance my skills in coding and design.</p>
  
 <p>Outside of my studies, I have a keen interest in photography, which allows me to capture the beauty of the world around me. Whether I’m exploring urban landscapes or natural scenery, I find joy in telling stories through my lens. I believe that both web development and photography complement each other by merging creativity with technical skills, and I’m excited to continue growing in these fields while seeking new opportunities to express myself and connect with others.</p>
